## Installation

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://https://github.com/waelchabchoub/portfolio-manager-springboot-and-angular-web-application.git
cd portfolio-manager
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

#### Frontend (Angular)

Navigate to the `src/main/app` directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd src/main/app
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment:

#### Backend:

Ensure you have the necessary database PostgreSQL with portfolio-manager set up.
Configure the database connection in application.yml in the Spring Boot project.

Navigate to the `root` directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
mvn clean install
```
### 4. Running the Project Locally

#### Frontend
To start the Angular development server, run the following command from the frontend directory:

```bash
ng serve
```
#### Backend
To run the Spring Boot application, navigate to the backend directory and run::

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Usage

### Admin Panel
The Admin Panel allows you to modify the content displayed on the portfolio, including your profile, projects, and CV. It uses JWT authentication to ensure that only authorized users can update the content.

#### Features:
- **Login**: Use the JWT login system for authentication. After logging in, you'll be granted access to the admin panel.
- **Manage Content**: Update your portfolio, CV, and project details through simple forms.
- **Save Changes**: Once youâ€™ve updated the information, it will be automatically reflected in your portfolio.

### Language Switching
The application supports English and German languages. The language can be switched using the language selector in the UI, and the content will be translated dynamically.

To change the language, use the translation options in the UI.

### Configuration

#### JWT Authentication
The backend uses JWT to authenticate users securely. The authentication process works as follows:

1. **Login**: Users can log in using their credentials (e.g., username and password).
2. **Token Generation**: Upon successful login, the backend generates a JWT token, which is sent to the client.
3. **Secure Endpoints**: The Angular frontend sends the JWT token with every request to protected endpoints (like the admin panel) in the HTTP authorization header.
4. **Token Expiration**: The token expires after a set period, and users will need to log in again to receive a new token.

For testing purposes, you can configure your JWT secret and expiration time in the `application.properties` file of the Spring Boot backend.

#### Multi-language Support
The project uses `ngx-translate` for multi-language support. Currently, the languages supported are:

- **English**: `en.json`
- **German**: `de.json`

Ensure that translation files are located in the `assets/i18n/` directory and follow the proper format.

#### Example translation file (`en.json`):

```json
{
  "PROFILE": {
    "TITLE": "My Portfolio",
    "DESCRIPTION": "Welcome to my portfolio website."
  },
  "PROJECTS": {
    "HEADER": "Projects",
    "DESCRIPTION": "These are some of the projects I've worked on."
  }
}
```
